!!! ''Thinking''

; February 2023

While I think the entire scenario is only partially realistic, and if the video wasn't meant to be just a meme then the entire argument could probably be considered a conspiracy theory, the general line of thought is scarily plausible.
<div>

# World governments aren't yet denying access to advanced AI technologies to the public to make it spread to very negative uses.
# This way an excuse for total control of the [[Internet]] will be put in place:
#* The generative AIs that the public will still have access to will be crippled.
#* Everything will require government identification, "to be sure that a real person is doing X".
#** Online anonymity even for morally correct causes will no longer exist.
#** World governments will have total control on the population with fallacious appeals to combating first against disinformation, and ultimately "non-morality" (anything the government just doesn't like).

With all the [[Issues of the Modern Web]], and the practical demonstrations of the amazing capabilities of AIs that are already available today, it's not absurd to think that conversational AI could soon kill websites.
<div>

* Advertisers could probably soon go to AI, because of the potential to deploy even more targeted ads, while simultaneously appearing less invasive to users.
* Writers and content creators could focus more on the content: not have to deal with SEO issues, and more easily deploy content thanks to APIs provided by the AI services instead of having to construct a website.
