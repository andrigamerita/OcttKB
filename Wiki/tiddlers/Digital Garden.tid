title: Digital Garden

I still haven't yet understood what are the exact connotations of this term.

* Defined as something you slowly curate over time with focus on the fact itself and not on the ultimate outcome/result
* It's definitely the opposite of a blog (no posts strictly related to date, preferably many small ideas, ...)
* Is a digital garden a [[Wiki]]? A [[Personal Knowledge Base]] with [[Zettelkasten]] method? Static [[Website]] with many "classic-style" WIP pages? A personal [[Notebook]] left open to the public to read?
