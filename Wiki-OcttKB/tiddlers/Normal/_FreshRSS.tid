* Site: https://freshrss.org
* Docs: https://freshrss.github.io/FreshRSS/
* Source: https://github.com/FreshRSS
* Docker: https://hub.docker.com/r/linuxserver/freshrss (wouldn't use it anymore, it was a pain to migrate from that to a manual config, more of a pain than it is to do the manual setup again, assuming you already have a web server ready)
