<<^wikipediaframe "Knowledge Management">>

Paradigms similar to this wiki:

* [[Obsidian|https://obsidian.md]]
** <<linkdescgit "🏡 Obsidian Digital Garden" "https://dg-docs.ole.dev" "Publish your notes to the web, for free. In your own personal garden." "https://github.com/oleeskild/obsidian-digital-garden">> --- Nice thing but it's sad that navigation is really borked without JavaScript.

The "Notion paradigm", and alternative apps:

* <<linkdesc Notion "https://www.notion.so" "Your connected workspace for wiki, docs & projects">> --- it's basically online-only (or online-first?), so not recommended since it's also entirely proprietary, and documents are very limited when exported
* <<linkdescgit anytype "https://anytype.io" "the everything app for those who celebrate trust & autonomy" "https://github.com/anyproto">>
* <<linkdescgit AppFlowy "https://appflowy.io" "open-source alternative to Notion for project management" "https://github.com/AppFlowy-IO">>

Misc:

* [[Dynalist|https://dynalist.io]]
