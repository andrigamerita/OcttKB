<<^wikipediaframe "Knowledge Management">>

The "Notion paradigm", and alternative apps:

* <<linkdesc Notion "https://www.notion.so" "Your connected workspace for wiki, docs & projects">> --- it's basically online-only (or online-first?), so not recommended since it's also entirely proprietary, and documents are very limited when exported
* <<linkdescgit anytype "https://anytype.io" "the everything app for those who celebrate trust & autonomy" "https://github.com/anyproto">>
* <<linkdescgit AppFlowy "https://appflowy.io" "open-source alternative to Notion for project management" "https://github.com/AppFlowy-IO">>
