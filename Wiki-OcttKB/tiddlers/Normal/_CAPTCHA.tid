<<^wikipediaframe CAPTCHA>>

* [[(Google) reCAPTCHA|https://developers.google.com/recaptcha/]]
** according to [[this support page, "Not seeing the checkbox and want an easier challenge?"|https://support.google.com/recaptcha#6262736]], while not explicitly said, I would think that there is a fallback version of reCAPTCHA for browsers without JavaScript... however, I don't think I've ever see it in practice
* [[hCaptcha|https://www.hcaptcha.com/]] --- emerged as a reCAPTCHA alternative a few years ago, now solidified and started experimenting with very strange verification pictures
* [[Cloudflare Turnstile|https://www.cloudflare.com/products/turnstile/]] --- another alternative that popped up few months ago, strangely with no visual puzzle ever
