!!! ''My Experience''

Done training on [[my main laptop|Octt/Laptop]], with PyTorch 2 nightly, and CPU training, because:
* I failed to install all required dependencies on [[my desktop|Octt/groso]], both on Void Linux musl (bare-metal) and Ubuntu Jammy (chroot).
* I now had to use my slow laptop, but issues with NVIDIA drivers meant no GPU training.

(TODO: Write my results)
