title: Saved/Sites

List of some Internet sites (Web and also other protocols) I want to save, for some reason or another. Sometimes they have interesting content, others I just like the aesthetic, or navigation experience. All here are miscellaneous, look in subpages for categories.

Some personal ones could be defined as "[[digital gardens|Digital Garden]]".
