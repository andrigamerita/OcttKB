title: Saved/Sites

List of some Internet sites (Web and also other protocols) I want to save, for some reason or another. Sometimes they have interesting content, others I just like the aesthetic, or navigation experience. All here are miscellaneous, look in subpages for categories.

Some personal ones could be defined as "[[digital gardens|Digital Garden]]".

** One easter egg is the client source code is hidden as a binary-encoded string represented by spaces and tabs; The server providing the data uses something (headers? but also other stuff) to only serve the real HTML to a browser; curl/wget without all the browser headers (and a browser after a reload in `view-source:` ?) get a fake HTML. <<#[ "Older but more in-depth analysis" "https://t.me/ioctt/19280">>
