!!!! ''Apps'' and the likes

; Lego block development: 
: [[Sketchware Pro|https://sketchware-pro.ga/]] - //Open-source mod of the proprietary and discontinued Sketchware app, for developing directly on Android// - [[[Git|https://github.com/Sketchware-Pro/]]]
: [[MIT App Inventor|https://appinventor.mit.edu/]] - //Before Sketchware, we had this//

; Minimalist development
: [[How can I build an Android apk without Gradle on the command line?|https://stackoverflow.com/questions/41132753/how-can-i-build-an-android-apk-without-gradle-on-the-command-line]]

</div>

; Classic development, directly on an Android:
: With these apps it's also easy to compile for very old API targets, unlike Gradle or Android Studio where it's basically impossible today
: [[Anacode IDE|http://www.anacodeide.com/home]] - [<<GPlayLink com.majosoft.anacode>>] - The app is freemium and apparently gives you 5-minute waits between build attempts after you build idk how many times (3? 5?)
: AIDE //IDE for Android// - [<<GPlayLink com.aide.ui>>] - This app is freemium but honestly unusable without paying the montly/annual fee (for example, you can't save code you edit after a while); ''grab patch for [[Lucky Patcher]]'' [[here|https://patch.chelpus.com/custom-patch-for-aide-ide-for-android-java-c++/3.2.210316]] or [[here|https://patch.chelpus.com/custom-patch-for-aide-ide/3.2.210316]] (I don't understand why the app name is different)
