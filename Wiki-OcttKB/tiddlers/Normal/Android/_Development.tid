: [[MIT App Inventor|https://appinventor.mit.edu/]] - //Before Sketchware, we had this//

; Minimalist development

* [[Android Studio|https://developer.android.com/studio]] by Google - Also includes the Android Emulator and some other tools - Warning: IntelliSense is very broken (at least for me)

; Classic development, directly on an Android:
: With these apps it's also easy to compile for very old API targets, unlike Gradle or Android Studio where it's basically impossible today
: [[Anacode IDE|http://www.anacodeide.com/home]] - [<<GPlayLink com.majosoft.anacode>>] - The app is freemium and apparently gives you 5-minute waits between build attempts after you build idk how many times (3? 5?)
: AIDE //IDE for Android// - [<<GPlayLink com.aide.ui>>] - This app is freemium but honestly unusable without paying the montly/annual fee (for example, you can't save code you edit after a while); ''grab patch for [[Lucky Patcher]]'' [[here|https://patch.chelpus.com/custom-patch-for-aide-ide-for-android-java-c++/3.2.210316]] or [[here|https://patch.chelpus.com/custom-patch-for-aide-ide/3.2.210316]] (I don't understand why the app name is different)
