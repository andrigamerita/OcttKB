''BitTorrent'' is an open [[peer-to-peer|peer-to-peer:en]] file sharing protocol. It is expecially common among the [[free sharing]] community.

Its only requirement for each user is a client application, meaning that efficiently sharing with BitTorrent is effectively free, since a beefy server isn't needed to make the content circulate.

For this reason, the protocol is most commonly used to share large files that have a lot of people requesting them, such as movies, operating systems, and videogames.

This kind of information would be usually expensive to share using a traditional client-server infrastructure, but with BitTorrent every client can seed (send) data to other requesting clients, exponentially optimizing delivery.
