title: Strange things

* [[https://venkivasamsetti.github.io/ebookworm.github.io/csehome.html]] --- this strange half-constructed half-recycled website hides copies of some CS books in PDF among generic pages, among with unrelated things like HTML5 games?

* [[StudyPlan.dev|https://www.studyplan.dev/]] --- strange C++ tutorials website with random, out-of-context (probably AI-generated?) cover pictures of random characters concept artworks...

* [[Toire no Hanako-san (folclore)|https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toire_no_Hanako-san_(folclore)]]

* [[PassSource|https://www.passsource.com/]] --- apparently something to create demo/dummy Apple Wallet passes? I have no use for it but they are very colorful

* [[Library of Babel|https://libraryofbabel.info/]] --- contains every kind of data that exists, will exist, and will not exist, all generated through randomness but it contains anything.
