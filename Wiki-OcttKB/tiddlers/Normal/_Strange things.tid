title: Strange things

* [[https://venkivasamsetti.github.io/ebookworm.github.io/csehome.html]] --- this strange half-constructed half-recycled website hides copies of some CS books in PDF among generic pages, among with unrelated things like HTML5 games?

* [[StudyPlan.dev|https://www.studyplan.dev/]] --- strange C++ tutorials website with random, out-of-context (probably AI-generated?) cover pictures of random characters concept artworks...

* [[^^^^^~ ░ ui▀┳╲ ☺ .info|https://yyyyyyy.info/]] --- just a mess collage of images, and the content changes at every site visit
* [[Smokepowered - 煙霧動力.com|https://smokepowered.com/]] --- strange site with weed background and video of Valve characters smoking
** [[Epic Blazed|https://epicblazed.com/]] --- same thing above, but for Epic Games, Unreal Engine, Fortnite

* [[ICCIVITELLA|https://iccivitella.it/]], <<httpsL it.knowledgr.com>> ... --- SEO spamming websites with fake content... which sometimes seem to have more actual content than real sites?

* <<httpsL www.chimica-online.it>>, <<httpsL www.scuola-e-cultura.it>>, ... --- sites that seem like SEO spamming but they seem to be administered by actual writers? they're kinda the most confusing

* [[AssemblyLT (Assembly Language Tuts)|https://www.assemblylanguagetuts.com/]], ... --- websites that seem to be constructed upon stolen domains, bought after expiration for no real good reason other than filling them with useless SEO-spam content; sometimes they seem to keep a part of the old content (or, more likely, made to look like the previous) present, but the most recent posts are always spam

* [[Questions LLC|https://questions.llc/]] --- //Use AI to answer
your questions. Our AI bots will answer your questions in seconds.// --- it's a Q/A website where supposedly bots answer the questions, and it's full of spam and useless shit, what's the point of it even? I found it coming from the footer of these oddly-specific websites, which only makes everything stranger:
** [[allowfullscreen|https://www.allowfullscreen.com/]] --- //an HTML attribute for the iframe tag// --- a website with some basic information about the attribute, but with some strange details, and some actually decent examples
** [[querySelectorAll()|https://www.queryselectorall.com/]] --- //a website dedicated to the best JavaScript function in the world!// --- some generic ass information about that JS function, with a home page full of cringey AI-generated SEO bullshit telling of the subject as if they were trying to sell the thing to a child... also includes information on partially unrelated things that maybe could have something to do with querySelectorAll but really not

* [[Toire no Hanako-san (folclore)|https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toire_no_Hanako-san_(folclore)]]

* [[PassSource|https://www.passsource.com/]] --- apparently something to create demo/dummy Apple Wallet passes? I have no use for it but they are very colorful

* [[Library of Babel|https://libraryofbabel.info/]] --- contains every kind of data that exists, will exist, and will not exist, all generated through randomness but it contains anything.
** Alternative version: <<YoutubeL w0XJ8D-TJtM "Database of Damascus - This Database Contains All YOUR Files (and Everyone Else's too)">>

* [[https://www.playemulator.io/]] --- very strange-feeling site with online ROMs emulators, due to all the SEO crap, and possibly wrong thumbnails applied to misleadingly titled games

* [[Pra' - Le Lavatrici|https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pra%27#Le_Lavatrici]] --- un quartiere che sembra una mezza piramide fatta di lavatrici giganti

* [[The Living Moka|https://www.thregr.org/wavexx/fun/tlm/]] --- letteralmente cosplay di una Moka lol
