[[Python|https://www.python.org]] is a high-level, general-purpose, dynamically-typed, and garbage-collected programming language, with an extensive standard library and mandatory-indentation style.

<<^wikipediaframe Python>>

I hate that, while tab-indentation is practically supported by the interpreter, it's against the standard, and linters/editors hate you if you use tabs instead of spaces. `micro` just won't let you persist the option to keep tabs enabled instead of spaces across sessions...
