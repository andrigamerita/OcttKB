[[Python|https://www.python.org]] is a high-level, general-purpose, dynamically-typed, and garbage-collected programming language, with an extensive standard library and mandatory-indentation style.

I hate that, while tab-indentation is practically supported by the interpreter, it's against the standard and linters/editors hate you if you use tabs instead of spaces.
