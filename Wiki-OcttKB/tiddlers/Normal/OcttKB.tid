!! Welcome to my Personal {[[Personal Knowledge Base]] \ Public Notebook}!

General information about the site will soon be available. Licensing information is available [[here|OcttKB/Licensing]]. This is "OcttKB" because I'm [[Octt]]. With this thing, I'm [[learning and thinking in public|https://www.swyx.io/learn-in-public]].

<!--
Apart from the usual [[TiddlyWiki]] ones, there are many methods of navigation on this wiki. For one, try clicking on the big name line on top of of this [[OcttKB]] tiddler.
-->

!!! ''Tips''
* Click on tag pills, often as present on top of a tiddler frame, just below the title, to navigate to all tiddlers that are tagged with that tag.
** Unlike with folders, a tiddler can have many tags at the same time, allowing for non-linear navigation.
* Click on different parts of the title of an open tiddler to navigate between children, both in a folder-like structure (other tiddlers present as path children of the current one, thanks to slash (`/`) separation), and with the tag structure (tiddlers tagged with the name of the current one).
