* What was once born as something supposedly to serve as an AI friend-counselor, to help people with mental health issues or similar problems, then became an operation devoid of any ethical consideration.
** Sexual features were integrated in the app and heavily publicized, to the long-term detriment of vulnerable users.
* It can be argued that the service never actually managed to fulfill its original goal in the first place, as some people:
** Got addicted to it and now live worse than how they did before.
** Got abused and directly manipulated by it, often into spending for premium features.

While I think the entire scenario is only partially realistic, and if the video wasn't meant to be just a meme then the entire argument could probably be considered a conspiracy theory, the general line of thought is scarily plausible.
<div>

# World governments aren't yet denying access to advanced AI technologies to the public to make it spread to very negative uses.
# This way an excuse for total control of the [[Internet]] will be put in place:
#* The generative AIs that the public will still have access to will be crippled.
#* Everything will require government identification, "to be sure that a real person is doing X".
#** Online anonymity even for morally correct causes will no longer exist.
#** World governments will have total control on the population with fallacious appeals to combating first against disinformation, and ultimately "non-morality" (anything the government just doesn't like).

With all the [[Issues of the Modern Web]], and the practical demonstrations of the amazing capabilities of AIs that are already available today, it's not absurd to think that conversational AI could soon kill websites.
<div>

* Advertisers could probably soon go to AI, because of the potential to deploy even more targeted ads, while simultaneously appearing less invasive to users.
* Writers and content creators could focus more on the content: not have to deal with SEO issues, and more easily deploy content thanks to APIs provided by the AI services instead of having to construct a website.

* Has political biases (both right and left, more towards the left).
** Viewpoints that in the future will be recognized as correct, could in the present be obscured by AI because of being deemed incorrect.
** Potentially the left-leaning bias is intentional because of being good for business.
