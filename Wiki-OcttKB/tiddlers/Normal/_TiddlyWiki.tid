[[TiddlyWiki|https://tiddlywiki.com]] is the software upon which this website is built.

It is a libre, JavaScript-rich, non-linear notebook, that can well adapt to anyone's way of building a logically interconnected information database.

; What I like
: All your content and app runtime can stay inside a single HTML file; it will probably work fine in browsers in the decades to come.
: The base software runs both in the web browser (ES5 or higher?) and [[Node.js]]; the latter makes it possibile to export tiddlers to  a file system programmatically, generate static sites, etc...
: Feature-rich and powerful out of the box, with (up to a certain point) high extensibility.
: Big community, meaning you can often get help with problems, and many third-party plugins are available.
: The default configuration works fine on mobile devices, unlike what happens with some plugins.

; What I don't like
: The Widgets/Filters/Macros systems is based on proprietary paradigms; they are made to allow people without programming experience to do great things, but are cumbersome and hard to learn if you already have common programming experience.
: [[JavaScript]] extensions are cumbersome, requiring a page reload to work after an edit
: It's not easy, or sometimes it's not possibile, to extend TiddlyWiki with just pure JavaScript, and trying to do so always requires ugly hacks.
: Widgets and Filters are essentially an interpreted language working on top of an interpreted language (JS); Since even the app core makes heavy use of them, it suffers from microlags even on modern devices, and can be's almost unusable on very old ones.
: No built-in tiddler compression and decompression means the HTML file is big by default (~2.3 MB as of v5.2.3) and can get worse with many plugins, causing slow loading and saving.

!!! Notes about ''official plugins''

* There exists the useful [[BrowserStorage plugin|https://tiddlywiki.com/static/BrowserStorage%2520Plugin.html]], good when working on browsers that crash or when tabs reload themselves.
** For optimal extra features like status indicators on tiddlers, or list of in-storage tiddlers, there exists the [[tw-browser-storage|https://btheado.github.io/tw-browser-storage]] plugin to extend the official one <<[# Git "https://github.com/btheado/tw-browser-storage">>. It has some technical issues so I made some edits: [[$:/plugins/btheado/BrowserStorage (drag to install)|$:/plugins/btheado/BrowserStorage]].

* [[TiddlyWiki Sharing Edition|https://tiddlywiki.com/share]] --- //allows users to create links to wikis with the special capability of containing embedded tiddlers that are loaded into the target wiki at startup//, all content encoded in the URL hash, by using the experimental Share plugin
