!!! [[Dash|https://www.dash.org/]]

//Dash is an experimental digital currency that enables instant, private payments to anyone, anywhere in the world.//

It's a fork of Bitcoin. There are some advantages, some technical and some situational, but a strange disadvantage I have seen appears to be that wallet syncs take a lot of time.
