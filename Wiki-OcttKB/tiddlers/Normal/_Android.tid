* [[I found a hidden folder called ".face" on my phone. It is full of faces cropped from pictures I've taken or downloaded.|https://xdaforums.com/t/face-folder-is-choking-with-thousands-of-files.1929380/]] --- it's apparently a Samsung thing (can't understand if it also happens on other ROMs), a cache for the built-in gallery face recognition system... only question is, why is this just on `/sdcard` and not in a proper cache directory? other people say it's used by the Android system in general, don't know if they have a Samsung ROM or not --- also see on <<RedditL r/Android/comments/2jm9j7/i_found_a_hidden_folder_called_face_on_my_phone/>>
