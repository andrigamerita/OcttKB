!! Welcome to my Personal {[[Personal Knowledge Base]] \ Public Notebook}!

General information about the site will soon be available. Licensing information is available [[here|OcttKB/Licensing]]. This is "OcttKB" because I'm [[Octt]]. With this thing, I'm [[learning and thinking in public|https://www.swyx.io/learn-in-public]].

<!--
Apart from the usual [[TiddlyWiki]] ones, there are many methods of navigation on this wiki. For one, try clicking on the big name line on top of of this [[OcttKB]] tiddler.
-->

!!! ''Tips''
* Click on tag pills, often as present on top of a tiddler frame, just below the title, to navigate to all tiddlers that are tagged with that tag.
** Unlike with folders, a tiddler can have many tags at the same time, allowing for non-linear navigation.
* Click on different parts of the title of an open tiddler to navigate between children, both in a folder-like structure (other tiddlers present as path children of the current one, thanks to slash (`/`) separation), and with the tag structure (tiddlers tagged with the name of the current one).

!!! ''Other Wiki Things''

I have made the following into links as they were making this tiddler very laggy, to the point of causing hanging issues on my mobile. Hold thight when opening them (if you're using the JavaScript-rich app, otherwise you're golden).
