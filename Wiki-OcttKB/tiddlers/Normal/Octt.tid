title: Octt

''Octt'', aka ''OctoSpacc'', or ''Andrea'', is me, the living entity who primarily maintains the [[OcttKB]]. I am powered by a natural neural network, in case that wasn't obvious.

<!--
Some info about me should go here, I suppose, so here are some points:
*

Not much else for now. -->

No info about me here for now. Tough luck. Maybe go read the about page on my [[sitoctt]] in the meantime: https://sitoctt.octt.eu.org/Chi-Sono.html

Here are some things I like or do or whatever, that I'm putting here honestly just to get some tiddlers connected together, because I like graphs like the ''Focus'' one on the sidebar.

* Graphs.. I just said I like them. Some others are at [[OcttKB/Data]]
* [[Playing videogames|Gaming]], but I have special taste probably
** [I should write my best picks here]
* [[Writing]], like on my [[sitoctt]] or here
* Software [[Development]], mostly frontend ([[CSS]] is crappy but epic)
** My [[Web]] places wouldn't be as unique if this wasn't the case and I were to only write content
