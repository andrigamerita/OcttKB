!!! Emulators

...WIP

* [[DeSmuMe|https://desmume.org/]] --- for some uses, still the most accurate and flexible NDS emulator, with better x86 support (but poor ARM performance) --- <<[# Git"https://github.com/TASEmulators/desmume">>
** https://github.com/44670/desmume-wasm
* [[NooDS|https://github.com/Hydr8gon/NooDS]] --- //A (hopefully!) speedy DS emulator.//

!!! Tools

* [[dlditool|https://github.com/devkitPro/dstools/tree/master/src/dlditool]] --- //Dynamically Linked Disk Interface patch tool// for NDS homebrew ROMs

!!! Development

* (WIP) [[NDS-Homebrew-Development|https://github.com/jdriselvato/NDS-Homebrew-Development]] --- //research for developing on the Nintendo DS//
* [[Nitro SDK in a Box|https://gbatemp.net/threads/nitro-sdk-in-a-box.622578/]] --- the idea for a VM setup with all kinds of useful software from official NITRO SDK (download not released, we might want to ask OP in private)
